## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) - CSS web layout model
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Programming language that extends JavaScript
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React build tool with local development server

### What I learned

I learned that I can create custom font families by downloading and adding font files, then defining font faces in CSS using the '@font-face' rule:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url("../assets/fonts/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
}
```

I also got more familiar with Bootstrap, Typescript and React.

### Continued development

- Bootstrap
- Typescript
- React

I found these techniques very useful. I will continue focusing on them in future projects to refine and perfect them.

### Useful resources

- [React Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=68I5Pxet-DNGzsdM) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me understand React, TypeScript and Bootstrap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning these concepts.
